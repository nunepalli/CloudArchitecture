2. Install the [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) VS Code extension.
3. Clone this project from GitHub to your computer
4. Open the root project folder inside VS Code, and when prompted re-open the window inside the container (or, from the Command Palette, select 'Rebuild and Reopen in Container').
5. View the README inside the devcontainer for tips and details about using devcontainer

   ```sh
   [vagrant@localhost ~]$ md /home/vagrant/README.md
   ```
